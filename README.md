# Pandemic Legacy Season 0 - Tracker Api

With by player group we just start the [Pandemic Legacy Season 0 Boardgame](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/314040/pandemic-legacy-season-0)

Having done the 2 others games, I have become accustomed to make a "table" on a sheet of paper to record every propagation card that has been drawn. It's a tedious process, but being able to tell if a specific city is in danger is a big advantage in the game.

As this process is tedious, I create the little application to simplify the process for me and my fellow partners
